The **old component** was an early implementation of how **old components** were handled. It is being replaced by "PBS.**Namespace.To.New.Component**", which contains more readable and flexible effect definitions.

Some of the legacy **old components** are still referenced and used (ex. **examples**), and should be replaced by their counterparts in the aforementioned class.
